Installation procedure for Live Blog v1.0 (for developers)
http://www.sourcefabric.org


PREPARATION
-----------

The following applications need to be installed prior to Live Blog:

1. Python 3.2
Live Blog requires Python 3.2 with standard libraries.

2. Java
Version 1.5 or later. The 'java' binary must be in the system path.

3. MongoDB 2.x
Not necessary for Live Blog after disabling the 'Article' part, as it is explained below.


INSTALLATION FROM SOURCES (FOR DEVELOPERS)
-------------------------------------------

1. Install the Ally-Py framework
See https://github.com/sourcefabric/Ally-py

I.e. clone the Ally-Py to a directory, e.g. /var/opt/ally-py
Content of that directory should comprise:
'build', 'components', 'distribution', 'plugins', etc.

2. Create a directory named "superdesk" inside Ally-Py directory and copy
the content of this package in.

It can look like /var/opt/ally-py/superdesk and its subdirectories
are 'build', 'distribution', 'plugins', etc.

3. Build eggs by running the following command:
[path_to_superdesk]/build-eggs

It can be e.g. /var/opt/ally-py/superdesk/build-eggs

4. Create the configuration files by running the following command:
[path_to_python3.2] [path_to_superdesk]/distribution/application.py -dump

E.g.: python3 /var/opt/ally-py/superdesk/distribution/application.py -dump
In this example the content of the package was copied in the
/var/opt/ally-py/superdesk directory and python3 binary is in the system path.

5. Start the REST Ally server by running the following command:
[path_to_python3.2] [path_to_superdesk]/distribution/application.py

E.g.: python3 /var/opt/ally-py/superdesk/distribution/application.py
Here python3 is supposed to be the python3.2 shell, available in the system path.

6. Use the web interface to the Superdesk
The admin interface can be accessed from a browser on the same system at
the URL: http://localhost:8080/content/lib/core/start.html

Log in with admin and password a

Access from the Internet
------------------------
In order to access the application from other machines the following changes
need to be done:

1. Edit the file 'superdesk/distribution/application.properties', search for
the property 'server_host' and change it to '0.0.0.0'
E.g.: server_host: 0.0.0.0

2. Edit the file 'superdesk/distribution/plugins.properties', search for the
properties 'server_url' and 'embed_server_url' and change them to
'[machine_name_or_ip]:8080
E.g.: server_url: my.machine.domain.com:8080

3. Restart the REST Ally server.

Embedding Live Blog into your site
----------------------------------

In order to embed the output of your liveblog into your site take the
following steps:

1. Open the admin interface (see above)
2. Select the blog that you want to embed from the menu
3. Click 'Configure Blog' button
4. Select an embed theme
5. Copy the content of the field 'Embed script' and paste it into your site
content.

Changing the database server
----------------------------

Edit the file superdesk/distribution/plugins.properties, search for db_superdesk.database_url
and modify the URL. E.g.:
db_superdesk.database_url: mysql+mysqlconnector://root:@localhost/livedesk

The URL is a string in the form
    ``dialect+driver://user:password@host/dbname[?key=value..]``, where
    ``dialect`` is a database name such as ``mysql``, ``oracle``, 
    ``postgresql``, etc., and ``driver`` the name of a DBAPI, such as 
    ``psycopg2``, ``pyodbc``, ``cx_oracle``, etc.  Alternatively, 
    the URL can be an instance of :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL`.

Read the SQLAlchemy manual for more details:
http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html

MongoDB related parts
---------------------
MongoDB is required for Superdesk, unless the 'Article' functionality is disabled.
Live Blog itself does not utilize articles, thus it is possible to leave the articles part out.

For disabling the 'Article' menu and functionality, set the 'excluded_plugins' option
in the superdesk/distribution/application.properties file, and restart the Superdesk then.
It shall be like:

# The prefix for the plugins to be excluded, something like: gui-action, introspection-request.
excluded_plugins:
- content_article
- content_packager
- content_publisher

For the complete Superdesk including the 'Article' part, the MongoDB database system is required.
You should read the http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
page if MongoDB is not already available on the system.
Under some Linux systems, it can be installed via: sudo apt-get install mongodb

The MongoDB system to be used can be set via options in
the superdesk/distribution/plugins.properties file.
The default setting is:

# The name of the mongoDb database
publisherService.mongodb_database: mongodb

# The port of the mongoDb server
publisherService.mongodb_port: 27017

# The address of the mongoDb server
publisherService.mongodb_server: localhost
